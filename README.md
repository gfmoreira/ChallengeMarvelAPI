## Challenge Marvel API

A simple website, performed to participate in the challenge [Desafio Frontend Fpass](https://github.com/holding-fpass/challenge-frontend-fpass)

## Concept

The user can query the name or initial of a Marvel character, then a reference image of the character will be displayed with a description, it is observed that some do not have images and/or description.

If the query has been made with a spelling error, a list will be displayed based on the query based on the first letter of the searched name.
